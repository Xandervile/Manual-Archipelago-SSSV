A Manual Archipelago implementation of Space Station Silicon Valley on the GameBoy.

Features:
- Level Access shuffled as items.
- Level Completion shuffled as checks.
- Animals shuffled as items.
- Killing Animals shuffled as checks.
- Evo's Body Parts as possible win condition.

Future Ideas:
- Shuffle Power Cells (Possible, need to massively add logic and naming conventions here)
- Shuffle Energy Cells (Possible, need to find them all)
- Shuffle starting level and animal (Possible, I need to get good and learn this)
- Shuffle Monitors as checks

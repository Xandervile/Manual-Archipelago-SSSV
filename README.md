A Manual Archipelago implementation of Space Station Silicon Valley on the GameBoy.

Features:
- Level Access shuffled as items.
- Level Completion shuffled as checks.
- Animals shuffled as items.
- Killing Animals shuffled as checks.
- Evo's Body Parts as possible win condition.
- Shuffle Power Cells as Locations.
- Shuffle Starting Level (but cannot use Animal Shuffle alongside due to limited game logic)
- Shuffle Monitors as Locations

Future Ideas:
- Shuffle Energy Cells (Possible, need to find them all)
- Add Trophies as a win condition
- Look into maybe a lua script to make it not a manual? Only I'm probs gonna use this anyway.

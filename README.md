A Manual Archipelago implementation of Space Station Silicon Valley on the GameBoy.

Features:
- Level Access shuffled as items.
- Level Completion shuffled as checks.
- Animals shuffled as items.
- Killing Animals shuffled as checks.
- Evo's Body Parts as possible win condition.
- Shuffle Power Cells 
- Shuffle Energy Cells 
- Shuffle starting level and animal (Doesn't work with Animals as Items)
- Shuffle Monitors as checks


Future Ideas:
- Different Win Conditions
- Shuffling BCP items - currently not done due to not wanting to play BCP multiple times as it SUCKS.
- Shuffling kills in Boss Levels (Currently not done for same reason as BCP)
- Shuffling other "collectables"/objectives in levels as locations.
